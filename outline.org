* me
** vagrant
** jquery mobile
*** test suite maintainer
* this
** browser focused
** testing barrier at jqcon
* motivation
** don't ship crap
** applications \not scripts
** JavaScript \crossout App
*** script has small/simple/fast conotation
* state of js testing
** no testing 
*** jquery top plugins
*** additional stats from github
** browser automation
*** slow
*** timing sensitive
*** great for cross page interaction testing
*** tests in language of choice
*** ci integration
** js test suites
*** fast
*** easy mocking
*** jasmine, qunit, other frameworks
*** limited ci integration
*** single page
*** state/timing 
* existing issues
** unit vs integration/uat 
*** unit
**** fast
**** fragile with change
**** easy to mock 
*** integration
**** slow
**** less fragile with change
**** harder mock server interaction

** ci integration
*** its at least semi difficult to setup
*** very little library support
** timing and events
*** menu show / menu hide
**** show menu in 200 ms w/ test expectation
**** show menu in 250 ms with breakage
**** ugh
*** bind to events 
** browser state
*** dom only
**** jasmine doesn't include state management
***** jquery-jasmine
**** qunit has it by default
***** qunit fixtures
*** applications
**** hash
**** url with pushstate/replacestate
**** localstorage
**** event bindings
**** the document title!     

* possible solutions
** ci integration
*** jasmine has nice ci integration for ruby
*** JsTestDriver
**** has its own framework/QUnit adapter
*** leverage browser automation
**** selenium selectors
**** pass / fail
**** failing tests
** timing vs events
*** bind to events
